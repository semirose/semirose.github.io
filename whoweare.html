Hello, I am 11 years old and I go to Seabury Middle School. I love coding, and I know 5 diffrent coding languages so far: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, and Python. I live in University Place, WA. Fiona and I met at a chess club and have know each other for the last 4 years. We are part of the 6th grade game company at school. The company is called Giggy Games Inc. We came with the expectation that we would just go and see what we could do, and bring that knowledge back to Giggy Games Inc.

Hello, I am 12 years old and I go to Seabury Middle School. I like art and I want to be an author or psychologist. I live in Tacoma Washington, and my mom is a art teacher. I have known Semira for 4 years, and we are good friends. When we came to Startup Weekend we weren't going to pitch an idea, but then someone gave us a pitch about pitching. We got some inspiration and pitched an idea, the idea took off... and here we are!</em>
