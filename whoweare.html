Hello, I am 11 years old and I go to Seabury Middle School. I love coding, and I know 5 diffrent coding languages so far: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, and Python. I want to be a Software Engineer, a Aero-Space Engineer, or a Robotic Engineer when I grow up. I live in University Place, WA. Fiona and I met at a chess club and have know each other for the last 4 years. We are part of a 6th grade game company at school. When we learned about Startup Weekend we knew we had to go! We were very intrested in learning more about business and technology.

Hello, I am 12 years old and I go to Seabury Middle School. I like art and I want to be an author or psychologist. I live in Tacoma Washington, and my mom is a art teacher. I have known Semira for 4 years, and we are good friends. When we came to Startup Weekend we weren't going to pitch an idea, but then someone gave us a pitch about pitching. We got some inspiration and pitched an idea, the idea took off... and here we are!</em>
