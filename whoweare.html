<h5>
The Team
</h5>
<p>
We have ten people on our team with us. The people on our team are great, they are supportive and fun. We all work together, and we don't get left out

<strong>Hello, I am 11 years old and when I met Fiona at a chess club, I knew we would be friends for life. When I swiched schools I was sad about leaving her, but, lo and behold, she join Seabury School the next year, and then we moved to the middle school campus together after I skipped 4th grade so we were in the same spot. When I invited Fiona to Startup Weekend, she accepted without delay, but she had a lacrosse game on Saturday, but we weren't going to pitch, so it was OK. Then somebody gave as a pitch about pitching, and we pitched an idea about a video game that taught kids how to code. We formed a team, which was more than we expected, and then, among 9 other groups of adults, our team won Startup Weekend Seattle on the weekend of the 9-11th!</strong>

<em>Hello, I am 12 years old and I go to Seabury school. I like art and I want to be an author or psychologist. I live in Tacoma Washington, my mom is a art teacher. I have known Semira for 4 years, and we are good friends. When we came to Startup Weekend we weren't going to pitch an idea, but then someone gave us a pitch about pitching. We got some inspiration and pitched an idea, the idea took off... and here we are!</em>
