    The Idea
    </h2>
    <p>
     <strong>
     Hello, my name is Semira and I'm 11 years old.
     </strong>
    I'm Fiona and I'm 12 years old.
     <strong>
     We realized there are 1 million coding or developer jobs that are unfilled due to lack of coders
     </strong>
    We need to start teaching kids how to code at younger ages, but when you look, as a middle-schooler, for resouces to do that, you find an overwheming lack of middle-school geared options.
     <strong>
     They have lots of games that teach drag-and-drop which is fun and can be great for exposing kids younger, but overall has very few real life implications. You also find coding that is type-based, but at the same time, it can get tedious.
     </strong>
    What Generation CODE's solution involes is a game that teaches code. What is this wonderful solution?

    <strong>
    It's a fun, interesting game that keeps kids attention so they can learn the code. 
    </strong>
